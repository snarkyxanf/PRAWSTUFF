Things written using the Python Reddit API Wrapper

unsave.py
---------

This is a script/several python functions which can bulk remove items from the saved list of your Reddit account.
If you're like me, you save items at a faster rate than you unsave them. If you want to declare readinglist bankrupcy,
this is an efficient way to do it.
